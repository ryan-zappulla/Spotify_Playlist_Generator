# Spotify Playlist Generator

  

## Running Locally

To run locally, you will need to add a config.json file with the following schema in the src folder

    {   
	    "access_token" : "",   
	    "refresh_token": ""
    }

You can get an access and refresh token by following the OAuth2 flow against Spotify using Postman: https://blog.postman.com/generate-spotify-playlists-using-a-postman-collection/
